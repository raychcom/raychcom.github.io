The turtles racked up 12.6k+ followers and 300k+ likes on TikTok—but I've moved all their content off the platform. You can now follow them [@turtles.raych.com](https://bsky.app/profile/turtles.raych.com) on Bluesky.

I have three red-eared slider turtles, all around 19 years old. I also keep two 20-gallon planted guppy tanks and share my home with a senior squad of dogs (down to one 😭😭😭).
