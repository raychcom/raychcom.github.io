    <p>Hi, I’m Rachel Sprague, aka Raych.</p>

    <p>I’m a Senior Data Analyst by title, but most of my day-to-day leans heavily into analytics engineering: building scalable data models with dbt and optimizing pipelines.</p>

  <p>Lately, I’ve been focused on AI-forward analytics—finding ways to integrate modern tooling and automation into real-world workflows.</p>

  <p>I work mostly in SQL and am experienced with tools like dbt, Snowflake, and Git. I care about clean code, useful metrics, and bridging the gap between data and decisions.</p>
