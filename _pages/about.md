<!-- Hi, I’m Raych 🏳️‍🌈 — a data wrangler, music consumer, and lifelong creative dabbler. -->

This site is the home base for my digital experiments: weekly music picks, personal projects, and whatever else I’m fiddling with. Expect traces of tech, music, and a small zoo of pets (three senior dogs, three turtles, and a couple of planted guppy tanks).

<!-- Welcome to The Cove. -->

Follow along here:
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31ekhjd5x5qoyln7zo4zkv4tneay?si=0f0673a420cc4a29) for playlists
- Bluesky for [microblogging](https://bsky.app/profile/raych.com), [photos](https://bsky.app/profile/photos.raych.com), [shorts](https://bsky.app/profile/shorts.raych.com), and [THE TURTLES](https://bsky.app/profile/turtles.raych.com) (and other pets). Yes, I split the accounts. Because I’m neurotic.

Thanks for stopping by 💚
