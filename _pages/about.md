Weekly music picks. Personal projects. Stuff. 

I’m a tech-y gal who listens to too much music and mostly hangs with my ~~fiancée~~ wife and pets. <br/>
<br/>

Follow along here:
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31ekhjd5x5qoyln7zo4zkv4tneay?si=0f0673a420cc4a29) for playlists
- Bluesky for [microblogging](https://bsky.app/profile/raych.com), [photos](https://bsky.app/profile/photos.raych.com), [shorts](https://bsky.app/profile/shorts.raych.com), [crafts](https://bsky.app/profile/makes.raych.com) and [THE TURTLES](https://bsky.app/profile/turtles.raych.com) (and other pets). Yes, I split the accounts.

Thanks for stopping by 💚
